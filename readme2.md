# asteroid_claim

I, wassname, also known as Michael J Clark of Perth hereby establish a formal claim to the following celestial bodies. This claim is established with explicit intent toward future resource utilization. This declaration constitutes the formal establishment of property interest


This claim encompasses the entirety of the bodies, including all constituent materials, spatial volume within 50 km of its center of mass, and any natural satellites that may be discovered in the future. The claim extends to all mineral, volatile, and material resources contained within this boundary.

## Legal Framework Anticipation
While acknowledging current limitations in international space law regarding private property claims on celestial bodies, this declaration is established in anticipation of evolving legal frameworks that will eventually recognize early, persistent, and well-documented claims as humanity expands into the solar system.
This claim explicitly respects scientific research access and non-interference principles while establishing priority for future commercial development rights when such frameworks emerge.

## Initial Registration
This property claim will be registered via distributed protocols including:

- Version-controlled repository documentation
- Public blockchain attestation
- Historical web presence
- Physical documentation
